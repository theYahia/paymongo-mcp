# paymongo-mcp

MCP server for [PayMongo](https://www.paymongo.com/) — the Philippine payment
gateway. Exposes payment intents, sources, payments, refunds, checkout sessions,
**payment links**, **webhooks**, **payment methods**, and **customers** as MCP
tools via Basic Auth.

| `create_source` | Create a GCash/GrabPay source |
| `get_source` | Get a source by ID |
| `create_payment` | Charge a source to create a payment |
| `list_payments` | List payments (cursor pagination) |

### Refunds

| Tool | Description |

## Quick Start

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paymongo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@theyahia/paymongo-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY": "<YOUR_PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | Secret API key from the PayMongo dashboard (`sk_test_…` or `sk_live_…`). |
| `PAYMONGO_ALLOW_LIVE` | No | Must be `"true"` to allow money-moving tools when a **live** key is used (see Safety). |

The server reads the secret key **lazily** — it can start and list its tools
without a key set, so a missing key surfaces as a tool-call error rather than a
startup crash.

## Amounts

All amounts are **integers in centavos** (the smallest currency unit):
`10000` = ₱100.00. PayMongo's minimum is typically `2000` (₱20.00) and varies by
method.

## Safety: test vs live keys

PayMongo keys are either **test** (`sk_test_…`) or **live** (`sk_live_…`). To
prevent an AI agent from accidentally moving real money, the money-moving tools
(`create_payment`, `create_refund`, `create_payment_intent`, `create_source`,
`create_checkout`, `create_link`, `create_payment_method`) are **refused** when a
live key is configured unless you opt in with:

```
PAYMONGO_ALLOW_LIVE=true
```

Read-only tools (`get_*`, `list_*`) always work. Tools are also tagged with MCP
annotations (`readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint`) so clients can auto-approve
reads and warn on destructive actions.

## Webhooks

Create a webhook to receive async payment events (e.g. `source.chargeable`,
`payment.paid`):

```
create_webhook { "url": "https://your.app/paymongo/hook", "events": ["payment.paid", "source.chargeable"] }
```

The response includes a per-webhook **signing secret** (`whsk_…`). Store it. When
PayMongo POSTs an event, verify the `Paymongo-Signature` header **before**
trusting the body — pass the raw request body, the header value, and the signing
secret to `verify_webhook_signature`:

```
verify_webhook_signature {
  "payload": "<raw request body, exactly as received>",
  "signature_header": "t=...,te=...,li=...",
  "webhook_signing_secret": "whsk_...",
  "mode": "test"
}
```

It computes `HMAC-SHA256(timestamp + "." + body)` and compares it (timing-safe)
against the `te` (test) or `li` (live) segment. This tool runs entirely locally
and needs no API key. Pass `tolerance_seconds` to also reject stale timestamps
(replay protection).
